Barely tested prototype that still includes some LLM generated code that needs further review.
You MUST review this code yourself before using.

TODO:
* Properly review `host_exec.h`.
* Change the sensor to use the command exit code?
* Make a number sensor that reads command output?
* Use root component for some kinda monitoring (currently its only there to make the build happy).
